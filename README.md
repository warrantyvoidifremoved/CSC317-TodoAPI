# CSC-317 Assignment: TodoAPI
## Deployed link: https://woolen-pickle-mat.glitch.me/
This project is a Node.js + Express.js web application that provides a persistent RESTful API for managing a Todo list, backed by a SQLite database. The backend supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Delete) on todo items. The frontend is a static HTML page served from the public/ directory, using the Fetch API to interact with the backend. Users can view all todos, add new ones, and delete existing items â€” all with data that persists across server restarts.
